/*
  1- This challenge is about using what you learned about reducing scope exposure and memoization
  2- We need you to provide a function called sumSquares, which sums the square values of integer values
  3- For example: sumSquares(0, 2) = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 5
  4- sumSquares receives two arguments: start and end. Being both inclusive in the sum.
  5- Use memoization to improve the performance of the function while controlling scope exposure
