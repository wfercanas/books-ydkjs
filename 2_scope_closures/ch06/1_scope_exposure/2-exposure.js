/*
  1- This challenge is about using what you learned about reducing scope exposure and memoization
  2- We need you to create two functions: sumAllSquares and sumRangeSquares.
  3- sumAllSquares sums all the square values from 0 up to the integer provided as arguments: sumAllSquares(2) = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 5
  4- sumRangeSquares sums all the square values from start to end depending on the provided arguments: sumRangeSquares(1, 3) = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14
  5- Use memoization in a single place to improve the performance of both functions while reducing scope exposure.
