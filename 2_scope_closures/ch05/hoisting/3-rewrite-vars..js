/*
  1- The author tries to explain hoisting through a metaphor
  2- The metaphor states that the JS engine re-writes our program before execution
  3- After such re-writing, the JS engine executes the code.

  Exercise: rewrite the program in 1-vars.js just like the JS engine would in the metaphor. 
  Note: the end result should be a version of the program that achieves the same results but where thinking about hoisting is no longer needed.
