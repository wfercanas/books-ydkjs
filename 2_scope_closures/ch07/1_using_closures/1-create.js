/* Exercise
- Create a function named "multiplier" which is a function factory that produces more functions.
- The function multiplier receives as argument a number that will be a multiplier factor by which you want to multiply always.
- The multiplier function returns a function that gets a number as a parameter and returns that number multipied by the factor received in multiplier function
- The returned function should be an anonymous arrow function.
- Use the factory to create multiplyBy2 and multiplyBy7 using multiplier()
- Create some variables using both multiplyBy2 and multiplyBy7
- Log these variables
*/

/* Questions
- Do you see any closure working here? Where?
- How many scopes are present in the program?
- How many different variables are being used as targets?
- Is there any shadowing present in the code?
