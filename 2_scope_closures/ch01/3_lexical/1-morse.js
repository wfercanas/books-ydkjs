/*
  Exercise:

  1- The objective of this project is to create a telegraph
  2- The user should be able to decide if he/she wants to translate strings into morse code or viceversa.
  3- If the user input is a string, the program should print the translation into morse code and viceversa.
  4- The morse code specifies silences between characters, replace such silences with spaces.
  5- The morse code specifies silences between words, replace such silences with a slash.
  6- The point can be replaced with a dot '.'
  7- The dash can be replaced with a '-'.
  8- The software has to implement testing. 
  9- The software should be executed and the input of the user captured in runtime. Use readline() in nodejs for that.
  
  Example: 
  -> 'hello' should print '.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..'
  -> More tests can be generated with https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html

  Questions:
  - How many buckets did you create?
  - How many sources vs targets?
