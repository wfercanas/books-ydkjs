/*
  Target: findLastIndex() array method.

  The exercise then consists on:
  1- Create the functions to make the grouping work using findLastIndex() in node v21
  2- Refactor the code so the we can still use findLastIndex() method in node v14 (polyfills)

  Note: remember to first create the test cases and then continue with the functions required.
