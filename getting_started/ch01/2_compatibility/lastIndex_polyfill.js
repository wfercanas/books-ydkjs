/*
  Target: findLastIndex() array method.

  The exercise then consists on:
  1- Create the functions to make the grouping work without using findLastIndex()
  2- Use the functions created and make them work as polyfill for the findLastIndex() method

  Note: remember to first create the test cases and then continue with the functions required.
