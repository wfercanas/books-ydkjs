/*
  As you may recall from the first set of exercises, in JS all objects are non-iterable. This means that they do not implement the Iterable Protocol.
  
  So, your challenge is to:
  1. Create the IterableObject class which extends from the Object class.
  2. Make all instances of IterableObject iterable.
  2. The iteration consist in returning each key-value pair of the object.
  3. Return them in an array. Example: ["name", "Mike"]
