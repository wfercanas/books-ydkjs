/*
  Solve the same problem as in exercise 1, but now we must use two functions:
  1. The first function gets two parameters and returns a function:
    1.1. initialNumber (Number).
    1.2. increment (Number): a constant that will be added iteratively.
  2. The returned function should be executed without parameters and be able to print the new value.
